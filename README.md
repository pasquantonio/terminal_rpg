# Text RPG

inspired by Stick RPG from my childhood.

I don't want to work with graphics or textures or a game engine. I also feel that the same spirit of the game can be achieved with good graphics. I may be alone in this idea considering the growth of NVDA stock and how all my friends talk about how good the graphics are in some games... but this never actually appealed to me. Graphics do not make a game good.

That being said, that doesn't mean that this game is going to be good. Nor does it mean that games with bad graphics are automatically good either. A good game creates something inside your brain.

## Start simple then expand

This game will start very simple.

You are the protagonist. (per usual). You have 3 attributes (strength, knowledge, wealth) which are divided out somewhat randomly to you but you can also change these somewhat in the beggining.

(this is already getting complex)

You move about in this small world. Earn money, gain knowledge, get stronger. And then you die at some point and are given a score.

## How do you die?

Not sure yet. Disease? No money? Hit by car?

## Score

You are scored by overall stats and wealth
